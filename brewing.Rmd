This is just a little page about brewing I hope to add to over time. 

Currently, it lists how much of each type of beverage I have brewed. 
Note that since I only started doing so recently, volumes thus far are tiny!

```{R Cumulative brewing, echo=FALSE}
brew <- read_csv("brewing.csv")

p <- ggplot(data=brew, aes(x=Beverage, y=Litres_brewed,fill=Beverage)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  geom_text(aes(label=Litres_brewed), vjust=1.6, color="white", size=3.5)+
  theme_classic()+
  labs(title = "Cumulative brewing to date")+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("lightgoldenrod2", "springgreen4", "darkgoldenrod3"))

p
```
