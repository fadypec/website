This is just a little page about brewing I hope to add to over time.

Currently, it lists how much of each type of beverage I have brewed. 
Note that since I only started doing so recently, volumes thus far are tiny!

```{R Cumulative brewing, echo=FALSE}
brew <- read_csv("brewing.csv")

brew2 <- brew %>%
    mutate(lab_ypos = cumsum(Litres_brewed) - 0.5 * Litres_brewed) 

p <- ggplot(data=brew2, aes(x=Beverage, y=Litres_brewed,fill=Additive1_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  geom_text(aes(y = lab_ypos, label=Litres_brewed), color="white", size=3.5)+
  theme_classic()+
  labs(title = "Cumulative brewing to date", y = "Litres brewed",
       x = "Beverage", fill = "Additives")+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("lightcoral","gray71",  "darkgoldenrod3"))

p
```
